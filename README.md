# Maze Creator and Solver

Welcome to the Maze Creator and Solver project! This web application allows you to generate and solve mazes using various algorithms. It provides interactive controls to visualize maze generation and solving in real-time. You can also resize the maze dynamically using sliders.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Create mazes using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.
- **Maze Solving**: Solve the generated maze using DFS or BFS algorithms.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Adjust the maze size with sliders.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time visualization of maze generation and solving processes.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the application at [maze.pawix.tech](https://maze.pawix.tech).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) that supports HTML5 Canvas.
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PawiX25/maze-creator-solver.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd maze-creator-solver
    ```

3. **Open the Project**:

    Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the application.

## Usage

1. **Generate a Maze**:
    - Click on **"Generate DFS Maze"** to create a maze using the Depth-First Search algorithm.
    - Click on **"Generate BFS Maze"** to create a maze using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.

2. **Solve a Maze**:
    - Click on **"Solve DFS"** to find a path through the maze using Depth-First Search.
    - Click on **"Solve BFS"** to find a path through the maze using Breadth-First Search.

3. **Resize the Maze**:
    - Use the **"Maze Width"** and **"Maze Height"** sliders to adjust the maze's dimensions.
    - Click on **"Resize Maze"** to apply the new size.
